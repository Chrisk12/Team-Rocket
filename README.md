## Latex
To compile latex files into pdf format, use `pdflatex <tex file>`.

## Ionic App
###Setup
- Go [here](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/) to see how to install ionic. (You will need nodejs and npm installed before doing this.)
- Now in a terminal, `cd` into the directory containing the app (named `RecCenterIonicApp`).
- From that directory, run `ionic serve` to see the app in the browser.

###Other info
- The files that we care about (js, html, css) are going to be in `RecCenterIonicApp/www`. The other files are pretty much just stuff that ionic needs. 
- AngularJS is the framework that is used with ionic. 
- You can build and emulate the ionic app on different platforms via `ionic platform add`, `ionic build`, and `ionic emulate`, but for our purposes `ionic serve` will probably be fine. 
- In Chrome, when you inspect the source (Ctrl-Shft-i), there is an icon on the top left of the inspect window that looks like two rectangles. If you click this you can change the size of the display in the webpage to match certain phone sizes.
